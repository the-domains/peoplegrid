For me, there's no arguing that organisational performance is linked to employee engagement. As the only "People & Culture" person on our leadership team, I was shocked to learn that not everyone believes this to be true!

Our Head of Sales is an incredibly switched on guy, he's extroverted, he's funny, he's loud, he's a sales guy right? You'd expect all of that, but he's also really caring, understanding and sensitive. A balanced and intelligent business leader... who doesn't seem to think culture and engagement are important at all!

We were coming to the end of a 2-day lock-down strategy session, trying to lock in budgets for Cultural initiatives when a heated and passionate conversation broke out. The loudest participants were myself and our Head of Sales. We went back and forth as I tried to get him to see the value of engaging our workforce. I argued the need for better communication from management, I fought for social events that were run by introverted developers, I went into battle for underperformers who we'd sucked the life out of... His point was valid, that people have a job to do, we pay them and everyone is an adult and should be responsible for changing things for the better, confronting people they have an issue with and resolving any engagement levels they might have. 

He touted a tagline for our impromptu tournament "we don't have to spoon feed them, just get on with it". I never suggested spoon feeding anyone, I still giggle thinking about it. He's a rational guy and he was being completely pig-headed, which I always find a little amusing for some reason.

After about an hour of debating whether we had a cultural problem, everyone at the session was close to yelling and to me, that proves the case. The fact that we argued so heatedly for so long means Culture & Engagement is clearly an issue that people feel strongly about, one way or another.
